# Homo Economicus and Rational Choice Theory

## Overview

This work explores traditional economic theories of **Homo Economicus** and **Rational Choice Theory**, contrasting them with insights from behavioral economics. **Homo Economicus** depicts individuals as entirely rational and self-interested, 
while **Rational Choice Theory** suggests that individuals maximize utility. These theories provide foundational models for economic modeling.

## Behavioral Economics

Behavioral economics introduces psychological realism to the economic models, highlighting how decision-making is often influenced by cognitive biases and emotional, social, and cognitive factors.

## Purpose

This paper briefly explores these theoretical perspectives, their interactions, and their implications for understanding economic behavior, providing a comprehensive overview of the shift towards more realistic approaches in economic theory.
